# COVID19 Diagnosis Predictive Model

## Introduction
Designed and implemented a ML classification prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained using COVID 19 symptoms dataset with features like age, fever, cough, etc. and predicts whether an individual is COVID 19 positive or negative.

## Methodology

### Libraries Used: 
NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, Seaborn, 5.	Matplotlib.pyplot

### Splitting the data into training and test set
The train-test split procedure is used to estimate the performance of machine learning algorithms when they are used to make predictions on data not used to train the model. It is a fast and easy procedure to perform, the results of which allow you to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for your predictive modeling problem. 

### Predicting the test set result
To predict the output of the set, a new vector y_pred is created. Now we need to compare the y_pred and y_test to check that how accurate is the prediction.
